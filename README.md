# Artificial_Intelligence-CS3AI18
## Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on health-related traits using machine learning techniques. Early risk assessment for diabetes can result in prompt action and better patient outcomes, making this task crucial for the healthcare industry.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains several health-related variables, including blood pressure, BMI, glucose levels, and pregnancy status, among others.

## Models Implemented
Three machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Deep Neural Network using TensorFlow

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Files Included
- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `prediction.ipynb`: Python script implementing different machine learning methods.
- `CS3AI18 CW.pdf`: PDF file containg the specifiction for this project.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
- Run each Python script to train and evaluate the respective model.
- Analyze the results and compare the performance of the models.

## Future Work
- Explore additional feature engineering techniques.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
- Collect more data to improve model performance.
